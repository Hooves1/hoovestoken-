# Community Repository

Note this repository is not the repository where the devs are working on. It has 2 purposes:

1. Keeping all the solidity files together to ease the work of auditors.
2. Publishing the already accessible solidity code that got verified on the blockchain onto one place.

FEG and it's environment is closed source  thus we will only upload the solidity files that are already public to see on the blockchain!

If something is missing  feel free to make a pull request.
